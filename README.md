# Install instructions:
**__Disclaimer: This is my very first rice, pardon me for not having an install script!__**<br />

・ Please symlink every folder in the `dotfiles` folder with the `.config` folder! Generally, the command would look something like: `ln -f ~/dotfiles/[folder_name] ~/.config/` <br />
・ For screenshots to work, please a `Pictures` folder inside your home folder, with a `screenshot` sub-folder in it<br />
・ For wallpapers, please make a `Documents` folder inside your home folder, with a `wallpaper` sub-folder in it. Please place all your wallpapers in this folder<br />

**__Another disclaimer: I have not configured swaylock yet__**<br />
